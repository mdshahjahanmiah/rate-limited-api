Rate-limited API
==============


Rate-limited API is an rate limiting solution and that can use for any parties, For example hotel management system, and designed to control the rate of requests that clients can make to a Web API.

## Documentation
## Project Structure
There are following three projects:
* **API : Rate-limited API**- Rate-limited API (Hotel Management System) is implemented by rate limiter to make decision whether request will be processed or not (Based on enpoind wise configuration).
* **Middleware : Rate Limiter** - Rate limiter is the main library containing custom action filter to apply rate limits on API endpoints.
* **Tests : Unit & Integration** - This is the test project for all components.

## Things you need
* **.Net Core 3.1, C#, SQL Server**
* Install and Run Docker
* Clone **rate-limited-api** repository : git clone **https://github.com/HasanShahjahan/rate-limited-api.git**
* After cloning, the appsettings.json, docker file and docker compose yml file will be in root directory of the cloned project.

## Setting the configuration
## Logging
To see the log level wise log, please specify the **log level** and  **path format** `appsettings.json`
```
"Serilog": {
    "MinimumLevel": "Debug",
    "WriteTo": [
      {
        "Name": "RollingFile",
        "Args": {
          "pathFormat": "C:\\Agoda\\HotelManagement-{Date}.txt",
          "outputTemplate": "{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff zzz} [{Level}] {Message}{NewLine}{Exception}"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```
## Connection String
To connect with Sql Server database, please specify your connection string. If nothing is changed then it will be created by below credentials. 

```
"ConnectionStrings": {
      "SqlServer": {
        "Queries": "Server=db;Database=master;User=sa;Password=Your_password123;"
      }
    }
    
```
## Rate Limiting
Configurable rate limiting policy per endpoint.Fallback to a default 50 requests every 10 seconds if no configuration is provided (Configurable).
```
"RateLimiting": {
      "Default": {
        "Period": 10,
        "Limit": 50
      },
      "Rules": [
        {
          "Endpoint": "/api/v1/Hotel/city",
          "Period": 5,
          "Limit": 10
        },
        {
          "Endpoint": "/api/v1/Hotel/room",
          "Period": 10,
          "Limit": 100
        }
      ]
    }
```
## Docker Compose Yml
Below docker compose configuration for web and dependable databse based on database connection string of application settings.
```
version: "3.9"
services:
    web:
        build: .
        ports:
            - "8000:80"
        depends_on:
            - db
    db:
        image: "mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server"
        environment:
            SA_PASSWORD: "Your_password123"
            ACCEPT_EULA: "Y"
```

## Running the API
We are ready to run the application. Please make sure your docker is running.Go to your favourite **Cmd/Terminal/iTerm** and run below command.

```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

Open your docker container and make sure below docker images are running under **Containers/Apps**
```
rate-limited-api
   rate-limited-api_db_1
   rate-limited-api_web_1
```
* Sometimes images are created under Containers but need to run by manually. If you found any of the image/both is/are not running, then run manually.
* After running properly, Seed data will be inserted to the mentioned database `hoteldb` under `Hotel` Table
 
## Testing the API
If everything goes well then we are ready to test API. As ealier we set application port 8000, we will be able to run by - 
```
Postman
http://localhost:8000/

$ GET : http://localhost:8000/api/v1/Hotel/city/Bangkok
$ GET : http://localhost:8000/api/v1/Hotel/room/Deluxe

Swagger
$ http://localhost:8000/swagger/index.html

```

## Considerations
API (Hotel Management System)
* "/api/v1/Hotel/city/{name}",that returns all the hotels belonging to a specific city.
* "/api/v1/Hotel/room/{type}", that returns all the hotels that have the requested.
* Both the endpoints can have an optional request to sort the hotels by price (ASC or DESC).

Middleware (Rate Limiter)
* Configurable rate limiting policy per endpoint per client.
* Support multiple endpoints in future.
* Fallback to a default 50 requests every 10 seconds if no configuration is provided (Configurable).
* Applies individual locks to prevent concurrent access by multiple threads. 
* Sliding window algorithm/technique is used for limiting requests.

Tests (Unit & Integration)
* Unit test for managers, services, repositories, validator, rate limiters using Moq framework.
* Integration test that calls all API's using HTTP (Test Server).

## Limitations
* Limits requests based on time window only; other limiting factors (e.g. location) hasn't been taken into account.
* Limiting requests per time interval with fixed precision of 1 second. This will create large memory foot prints for larger window.
* If the rate gets higher than the threshold on an endpoint, the API should stop responding waiting threshold/seconds on that endpoint ONLY, before allowing other requests.
